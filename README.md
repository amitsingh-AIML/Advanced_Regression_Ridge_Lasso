A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. 
The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price
Problem Statement - Model the price of houses with the available independent variables. 
This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. 
They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
The company wants to understand the following :

-Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

-How well those variables describe the price of a house.

A linear model was built using RFE , VIS and p eliminations , however it overfitted.
Ridge and Lasso regression wiere applied on the data to arrive at 0.83 Train and Test r2 scores
